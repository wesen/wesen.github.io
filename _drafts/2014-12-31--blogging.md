title: Blogging in the new year
category: article
---

This is the cheesiest new year's resolution: 
this time I will keep blogging.
I did in fact manage to keep one blog pretty steadily when I was 22,
it still is online at [Netzstaub](http://blogs.bl0rg.net/netzstaub/),
and it got me both a job some press coverage.
Then, [things](http://ruinwesen.com/) happened and then more things happened
and my life changed 
and I never got back to writing.

I sometimes, full of enthusiasm, 
start a tumblr or a blog to document 
whatever technical fancy or hobby I am pursuing at the moment.
Hobbies I never keep for very long, 
and with them dies the blog. 
I miss writing up my technical experiences and more mundane thoughts,
and stumbled upon the [You should write blogs](https://sites.google.com/site/steveyegge2/you-should-write-blogs) essay
by Steve Yegge on Hacker News a couple of days ago. 

I started taking short notes about steps I take at work in evernote,
and much more religiously capturing interesting webpages when I see them.
While I rarely go back and search for captured tidbits,
I do sometimes idly browse through past subjects of interest and read up on them again.
I also like the feeling of confidence that something interesting is archived that
evernote gives me.
