I have been keeping a paper sketchbook for the last 5 years.
I use it mostly to write down notes about topics I am studying,
and to draw. Occasionally, I write down TODO lists, 
design software solutions for problems I am having at work,
or explain solutions and software architectures to other people.

A lot of my notes and drawings are derivative,
the sketchbook is more a tool of study than it is one of artistic
expression (or of work/research when using it for maths and CS).
Some sketchbooks are much prettier than others,
but the prettiness usually comes at the expense of freedom.
Trying out new ideas or drawing from life or just figuring out
the solution to an exercise is much messier 
than writing down excerpts and diagrams from wikipedia.

Looking back at the stack of 40+ sketchbooks I have, 
I am reminded of how many different artistic techniques
I tried out over the years: watercolor, acrylics, chalk,
felt tip pen, fountain pen, ink wash, 
how many different drawing styles, design approaches,
sketchbook formats.

I have been using the same sketchbook approach for more than a year
now: Muji spiral bound sketchbook, fountain pen and occasionally watercolors.
It feels like this has been the way I have been sketchbooking forever,
but it actually took me more than 2 years to get there.

I don't exactly know what I am trying to express in this post,
except that I am torn as usual between the derivative (falsely studying)
and the inventive (for which I am too lazy, and have to try really hard).

XXX - 

XXX - maybe I should start a blog post with a main topic that I want to write
about, and write it out in bullet points / ideas that I then expand.
