# Mixing: hitting the first wall

I have been mixing a lot of different tracks from puremix,
and started to stray from the video tutorials.
Step-by-step video tutorials have a tendency to boost your confidence:
you get good results despite having no real idea of what you are doing.

Deviating from the prescribed steps quickly made it clear that I don't
even have a reasonable idea of what sounds good in the first place. I
don't know if a mix is punchy or not, I don't know if a snare sounds
good in context of a beat or a whole song, I don't know if the bass is
loud enough compared to the kick.  Part of that is that I don't listen to
this kind of music very often, part of that is me mistrusting my taste,
and part of that is a lack of ear training and knowledge.

I am following the advice of some professional mix engineers on IRC,
and try to make complete mixes of songs up front, before digging into
the tutorials. This is excruciatingly hard, but probably the best way
to make progress right now. I am still figuring out how to best assess
my results, and one good way I found is to remix the same part in a
variety of ways, rendering out the different results as I go along,
and listening back to them later on, both on headphones with waves NX,
on headphones without waves NX, on laptop speakers and on my home
speakers.  I realize that all three indicate different things in the
mix. It is very easy to be fooled on the headphones.

I am also doing "mixes" of maschine songs. The disheartening part
about this is that usually, my mix is worse than the original
"straight out of maschine" mix. I hear things I don't like about the
maschine mix, but I am unable to improve it without losing the "soul"
of the piece.  The good thing about realizing this is that I have the
exact same problem when I try to polish / finish my own songs.


# Andrew Scheps, DAW templates and parallel processing

After hitting that little wall with remixing the maschine stems,
I went back to puremix in order to do something "gratifying", as in
watching a video and then redoing a mix. By that time, a new video had been posted:
Andrew Scheps and his DAW mixing template.

While Andrew Scheps' template is quite confused and messy, at least
for my taste, it gave me some interesting insight into what a template
is. Obviously, it is a set of tracks and busses and effects already
set up, so that a session can be imported without having to set up a
ton of routing.  However, it also showed me that it can be the ever
evolving container for certain approaches to shaping / mixing
sound. For example, Scheps tends to have a crush bus for parallel
compression on the drums, one on the bass, sometimes one to gel the
bass and the drums together, one rear buss (which is the rear bus on
his analogue console) to parallel compress all the instruments except
bass and drums.  These busses and the compressors on them will change
over time, with one being phased out in favor of another. Some busses
might end up not being used in a session, but they are there if
needed.

Other examples of already set up "patterns" are a chorus, exciter,
slap delay and parallel compression bus for the vocals, a different
set of reverbs / gated reverbs / compressed reverbs for instruments
such as guitars and keys, and of course a master chain for the stereo
buss.

# S1 session layout

I decided to spend some time setting up a S1 template using some of
the approaches that Scheps is using: a lot of parallel compression, a
rear buss for all instruments except drums and bass, more parallel
compression, and exciters for background and main vocals.

I also used something similar to the naming convention shown to me by
an engineer on IRC.

I have busses for all main groups of instruments: `[DRUMS]` for drums,
`[BASS]` for bass, `[PERC]` for percussion, `[GUITARS]` for guitars,
etc...  These busses contain both the instrument group, and all the
sends that might be involved.  All these busses go into a `[MAIN]`
bus.

For example, `[DRUM]` busses all the
drums, as well as the drum reverbs and the parallel compression. In
this case, I will have sub-busses called `KICK`, `SNARE`, `HATS`,
`ROOM` to bus the individual components. These are placed left of the
main `[DRUMS]` bus.  Individual tracks are placed left of their
respective bus, and FX sends going into a group bus are placed to the
right. Parallel compression / exciter sends are labelled `|| KsCrush`
(camelcase), while reverbs and delays are labelled `> DrumRoom`.

The reason for routing the FX channels into the individual
subgroups is that it allows me to control a whole group of instruments
with one fader, without having to worry about individual send levels
if the FX tracks where to be routed directly into the `[MAIN]` bus.
The purpose of the `[MAIN]` bus is to give me an immediate visual
feedback about the gain staging going into the final effects chain on
the stereo buss.  I can quickly adjust so that the master compressors
get hit in their butter zone.

On top of that, I have a separate VCA fader for each bus itself,
which are all grouped on the right of the mixer. This allows me to quickly control
all groups independent of what actual group I am currently working on.

I heavily use mixer view snapshots. I have one that shows all the tracks,
which I use only in rare cases, and then one per instrument group, so
that I can focus on a few tracks in particular. However, I always have the VCAs
on the right allowing me to adjust the overall balance and the gain staging into
the output buss.

The colors I use are just the predefined S1 colours, using the bottom row
for drums and then going upward, in the order drums, percussion, bass, guitars,
keys, horns, background vocals, vocals.

This has been an instructive undertaking. Boiling everything down to a fixed
structure with fixed naming gives the session a lot of clarity. I love how
certain patterns (say, the rearbuss idea that Scheps uses) can be encoded into a
template, and then used or not depending on the project.

# Mixing fly rasta in S1

I went back around and rewatched some puremix videos I watched at the beginning.
One of them was the song "Fly Rasta" mixed by Andrew Scheps.

- rear buss
- not a lot of EQ, but rather use parallel compresson / exciters in parallel
