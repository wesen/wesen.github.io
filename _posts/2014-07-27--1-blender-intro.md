title: Blender notes - introduction
category: articles
---

I am trying to learn blender in a serious manner. I am following a lot of tutorials
online, trying to replicate animations I see. I will probably keep using Zbrush heavily
for modeling, as I feel more comfortable with the zbrush tools.

To keep track of what I am doing, I am going to write a few articles everytime I try
and learn something new. These could be either simple notes or more in depth articles.
